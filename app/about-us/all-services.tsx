                        When we discuss your sewers and drains, it‚Äôs easy to confuse their functions,
                        let alone keep their jobs straight in your mind. While they are both responsible
                        for removing wastewater from your home, they also connect your home to the public sewer
                        <br /> <br />
                        system. It‚Äôs important
                        to take care of your drains and sewer lines because when they are clean and reliable,
                        they keep your home waste removal system hygienic and safe.

                        A drainpipe functions to take water away from your plumbing fixtures. Drainpipes remove anything from moderately clean water to filthy wastewater. The level of contaminants in the water determines whether water is clean or dirty. Sewer cleaning services are required when the fluids and materials that go down your drain leave behind residue, grim, and dirt byproducts.
