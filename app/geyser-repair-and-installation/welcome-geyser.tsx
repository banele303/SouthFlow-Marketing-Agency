                    Geyser Repair & Replacement

                    A minor to severe leak from a geyser in the ceiling can not only be
                    a nuisance but can also inflict significant harm to ceilings,
                    carpets, and appliances. If a geyser is improperly installed, it could
                    pose a serious risk, potentially leading to an &quot;explosion&quot; in your roof.
                    Hence, it&apos;s crucial that a geyser is installed by skilled and certified plumbers,
                    equipped with the required pressure reducing valves, appropriate safety valves, a
                    geyser tray with an external overflow pipe, and a Certificate of Compliance.

                    installed in either a horizontal or vertical orientation.üõ†Ô∏èüíß
